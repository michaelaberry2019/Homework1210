            <img src="https://placehold.it/100x100" alt="yourname">
            <p>Currently learning to be a Full Stack Web Developer; because I want to know how stuff is built. I have 10
                years experience in IT support roles including Deskside Engineering. I have worked on Major IT
                infrastructure changes, smaller projects, have been sponsored for leadership programs. I love figuring
                out systems and how they relate to human behaviour. My years working for corporate enterprize has shown
                me that having a state of the art system is pointless if no human is willing to touch it.</p>
